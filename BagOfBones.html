      If you are a fan of horror or the paranormal I highly recomment that you check this book out. I graduated in 1999 and I remember reading this my senior year. Rarely do I find a book where everything around me fades out. <em>This is one of those books.</em>

    <h3>Spoiler Alert!</h3>

      <blockquote>
        [Bag of Bones] focuses on an author who suffers severe writer's block and delusions 
        at an isolated lake house four years after the death of his wife. The book 
        re-uses many basic plot elements of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, which is 
        directly referenced several times in the book's opening pages; however, 
        the relation of these elements (including a wife who is dead as the book 
        opens, her posthumous effect on future romance, a drowning, and house 
        haunted by the memories of previous inhabitants) to the plot and 
        characters is markedly different.
